The line plot below is the result of running the k-means algorithm on the body sway stability datasets, resulting in 3D visualization of the left-right and front-back moving timeseries datasets. For demo purposes, all the k-means clustering data were pre-generated using 12000 number of input parameters, a subset of 144 samples, and displayed instantly .
